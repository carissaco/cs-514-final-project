My proposal for my final project is that I will make an educational question and answer game. 
I can use openAI to generate the questions and answers that will be used in the game, and I think this game will be useful because I can ask openAI to generate questions and answers containing specific keywords to make the questions more memorable or fun.
An example of how I can implement AI is I can ask openAI to give me a math word problem at 4th grade level math that involves animals. This could be helpful because creating questions that involve a topic that a student might be interested in, such as animals, could make learning math more fun.
