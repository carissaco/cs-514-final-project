#cs-514-final-project

Overview of projectâ€” what problem are you solving, who is the client or target audience, and what is the plan moving forward for the project (after this class is over):
The problem I am solving is that some kids might not like solving math problems because they get bored or have a short attention span.
Because this website allows you to generate math problems related to a topic of interest, people will be able to find solving the problem more interesting, and learning math can become more fun and engaging!
The client or target audience would be anyone who wants to solve simple math problems or learn simple math. It would probably be students in elementary school (probably like first or second grade), since the math problems generated by chatGPT are pretty simple arithmetic.
My plan with this webiste moving forward is to implement the correctAnswer counter that I have started, but I have not implemented in the project yet.
This will display the number of correct answers on the screen in addition to what I already have, which is just the number of questions the user answered.
I also want to implement an option that allows you to put in your grade level so that math questions of the corresponding difficulty can be generated. I think it would be interesting to see what types of questions are generated if you put your grade level as college level calculus. Since I work as a tutor for K-8 students, I could also have them test this website and see if it is effective at making solving math problems more fun.
I also want to continue working on the UI and make the website more colorful and look more like a game rather than a plain website. I think adding animations and AI generated images to go along with each question would make the website even more fun.


How to run/deploy: Give coders instructions on how to get started with the code

In order to run and deploy, first clone my project from github.

```
git clone https://github.com/carissaco/cs-514-final-project.git
cd cs-514-final-project
```
start the backend:
```
cd .\datastore-books-example\
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
Now, start the React frontend in another terminal:
```
cd cs-514-final-project
cd react
npm install
npm start
```
Now, you can go to your [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) on the web browser and start playing the game
